# PROJECT-PORTFOLIO -- Google Playstore -- Data Analysis with Python

**Introduction**

The Google Play Store, being one of the largest digital distribution service platforms, hosts millions of apps spanning various categories and genres. Understanding the patterns and trends in this dataset can provide valuable insights to developers, investors, and marketers. The goal of this study is to analyze the Google Play Store dataset, focusing on answering the following questions:
1.	Which app categories have the highest average rating?
2.	Which categories have the most installs on average?
3.	Is there a correlation between rating and number of installs?
4.	Do paid apps generally have better ratings than free apps?
5.	Which genres are most common in highly-rated apps (rating > 4.5)?
6.	Which content ratings (e.g. Everyone, Teen, Mature) have the highest-rated apps?
7.	What is the average price of apps per category?
8.	Is there a relationship between price and installs?
9.	Do recently updated apps tend to have better ratings?
